## Udacity Project: Portfolio Site
This is my Portfolio website project for udacity. Live version can be found here :

This is a resubmission of portfolio project. Logo in the project rubrics was mistaken for icons. A logo has been added. Also changes have been made to the navigation menu has required(the use of flex instead of display-in-block). 

Flexbox layout was used. Logo used is the udacity svg logo from https://freebiesupply.com/logos/udacity-logo/ and was altered for the purpose of this project only. The author will create her own specialized logo.Hamburger menu code implemented was from the udacity lesson on hamburger menus. The navigation menu links (e.g ABOUT), will be updated live as the course goes on. Presently does not navigate anywhere.  A placeholder image from https://imgplaceholder.com/ was used.
